# 🌱 Carbon Farming Rewards Platform

Welcome to an innovative Web3 solution for combating climate change! This project creates a decentralized incentive program on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Farmers and landowners are rewarded with tradeable carbon tokens for verifiable improvements in soil health, which sequester CO2 and contribute to global emission reductions. By tokenizing carbon credits, we enable a transparent, tamper-proof marketplace that encourages sustainable agriculture worldwide.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Register farms and track soil health metrics on-chain  
💰 Earn tradeable CarbonTokens (CT) based on verified carbon sequestration  
📊 Submit and verify soil data through decentralized oracles  
🔄 Trade tokens in a built-in marketplace for emission offsets  
🗳️ Participate in governance to evolve program rules  
📈 Stake tokens for bonus rewards and voting power  
✅ Prevent fraud with immutable audits and multi-signature verifications  
🌐 Integrate with global standards like Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) via oracles  

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a secure, scalable system. Here's a breakdown:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Handles farmer onboarding, farm registration, and profile management.  
2. **SoilMetrics.clar**: Allows submission of soil health data (e.g., organic matter levels, carbon sequestration estimates).  
3. **OracleVerifier.clar**: Integrates external oracles for validating real-world soil data against on-chain submissions.  
4. **CarbonToken.clar**: The fungible token contract (SIP-010 compliant) for issuing and managing CT rewards.  
5. **RewardDistributor.clar**: Calculates and distributes tokens based on verified metrics and program formulas.  
6. **TokenMarketplace.clar**: Enables peer-to-peer trading of CT for STX or other assets.  
7. **StakingVault.clar**: Allows users to stake CT for additional yields and governance participation.  
8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Manages proposals, voting, and parameter updates using staked tokens.

**For Farmers/Landowners**  
- Register your farm via FarmerRegistry with details like location and baseline soil data.  
- Submit periodic soil improvements (e.g., via lab reports) to SoilMetrics.  
- OracleVerifier confirms data authenticity using off-chain sources.  
- Claim rewards from RewardDistributor, receiving CT proportional to sequestered carbon (e.g., 1 CT per ton of CO2).  
- Stake your CT in StakingVault for extra incentives or sell on TokenMarketplace.

**For Buyers/Offsetters**  
- Browse available CT on TokenMarketplace to purchase carbon offsets.  
- Verify token origins using SoilMetrics and OracleVerifier for transparency.  
- Use GovernanceDAO to propose changes, like adjusting reward rates.

**For Verifiers/Oracles**  
- Call functions in OracleVerifier to submit validation proofs.  
- Ensure data integrity to prevent double-counting or fraud.

That's it! A decentralized ecosystem turning soil health into a global asset for emission reductions. Deploy on Stacks for low-cost, Bitcoin-secured transactions.
